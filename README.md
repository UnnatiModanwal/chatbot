# chatbot
chatbot project for bank system
This repository contains an interactive FAQ chatbot built in Python. It uses basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (NLTK, TF-IDF) and a simple lookup/detection logic to answer user questions related to banking and other predefined topics. Key features include:

- **Python & NLTK**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for preprocessing.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts user queries into feature vectors for matching.
- **Simple Intent Matching**: Maps cleaned queries to predefined responses stored in a dictionary.
- **Easy to Extend**: Add or modify questionâ€“answer pairs in the `faq` dictionary.
- **Interactive CLI**: Runs in the terminal, prompts the user to type a question, and prints back the best available response.
